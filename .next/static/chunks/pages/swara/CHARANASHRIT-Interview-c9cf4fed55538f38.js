That was the beginning of my spiritual and yogic life. One day, I was walking near Shiva Ganga, the sacred pond of Lord Siva in Deoghar. Opposite the pond I saw a tantric, with no clothes on and his body, which was smeared with ash. He called me and  I went to him. He asked whether I knew swarodaya. When I answered in the negative, he said that I did know, but had forgotten. He reminded me that this was the science of the breath as founded by Lord Siva, and I was the one who was chosen for this knowledge. He gave me a book on Swara Yoga and a basic out line of swara sadhana. He asked me to read the book and to do my sadhana for three days. Thereafter, if I had a doubt, I was to go back to him. When I went to look for him, there was no trace of such a person and no one in the vicinity had any knowledge of him. I realised then, that he did not want to give me this knowledge directly. He wanted that I should practice sincerely. As I started my swara yoga sadhana, I wondered whether this practise could be scientifically supported. After practising continuously I realised that this valuable science enables us to enrich our lives not only materially, but spiritually as well. It was thus natural for me to pursue this course of study at Bihar Yoga Bharti.

During the flow of Pingala or the right nostril, the left brain hemisphere is active, and during the flow of Ida or left nostril dominance, the right brain hemisphere becomes active. Studies have indicated that the performance efficiencies of verbal and spatial tasks during both phases of the nasal cycle demonstrated that verbal efficiency is greater while the subjects were breathing primarily in the right and that spatial skills were enhanced during left nostril dominance.

Depression is the result of emotional blockage, which is controlled by the Ida nadi.

The left brain hemisphere or PINGALA nadi, governed by the flow of breath through the right nostril, is responsible for the rational, analytical, logical and mathematical intellect. It has been suggested that left nostril dominance stimulates the Pineal gland, and findings suggest that the pineal is the psychic gland connected with Ajana Chakra. All the psychic phenomena such as clairvoyance, telepathy, pre cognition, etc are controlled and guided by the pineal gland. Therefore, nadis are closely connected with the neuro-endocrine function of the body. Once the physiological connection and the functioning of the brain with the nadis is understood, it is easy to understand that both the nadis have different effects on our body and mind. Each of the brain hemispheres is active at different times. Therefore, only half of the brain is being used at any given time. If both hemispheres of the brain, and both the nadis can be used together, then all these forces can be combined for creative and productive work in all dimensions of life.
